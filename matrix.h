/*
 * matrix.h
 *
 * A pure C99 linear algebra header for type-generic matrices.
 *
 * Features:
 * - Type-generic matrix representation using void pointers
 * - Element-wise operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
 * - Determinants, inverses, and transposes
 * - Custom memory management and arithmetic logic via function pointers
 *
 * This design allows support for multiple numerical types (e.g., float, int, double)
 * and allocation strategies by plugging in appropriate arithmetic and memory function sets.
 *
 * Hungarian Notation Key:
 * - pv_  : pointer to vector_t
 * - cpv_ : const pointer to vector_t
 * - pm_  : pointer to matrix_t
 * - cpm_ : const pointer to matrix_t
 * - psz_ : pointer to size_t
 * - csz_ : const size_t
 * - pfn_ : function pointer
 * - pu8_ : pointer to unsigned 8-bit integers
 *
 * The provided matrix.h and matrix.c files are explicitly designed to work with the implementations used in these files.

/**
 * Writing custom operation functions.
 *
 * Imagine your matrix_t is using a type which does not have easy-to-use operations provided by the C99 standard.
 * You would need a way of defining your own operations which could be used by matrix_t.
 *
 * On top of what is already provided by matrix.h, the ability to create and utilize custom operation definitions
 * is also possible thanks to the use of callback functions.  This is to serve as a tutorial for creating a simple
 * callback function.
 *
 * matrix.h utilizes callback functions in a way that is comparable to the preexisting structure of functions like
 * mtxadd, mtxwrite, etc.  To write your own callback function, it must have exactly three parameters:
 *  - Parameter 1 (void*) - This is your result from the operation.  For addition, this would be the address to the location of the sum.
 *  - Parameter 2 (const void*) - This is your left operand location.  It is to be treated solely as readonly.
 *  - Parameter 3 (const void*) - This is your right operand location. It, too, is to be treated as readonly.
 *
 * YOU DO NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT MEMORY MANAGEMENT IN THESE CALLBACKS, matrix.h handles that for you.
 *
 * To write operators, simply modify the dereferenced and interpreted value of the result (*(your_type*)your_result)
 * Once the operation is finished, call "return;."  Remember, this function does not return anything, all data storage is
 * handled through the parameters.
 *
 * For an example of how arithmetic callbacks should be written, please see the GENERAL_OP_DEFINITION macro
